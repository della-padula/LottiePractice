# 1. Animation includes in this Project  
### 1.1. Switch Animation (Animation Distribution)  
I divided animation into two parts.   
The switch-on animation and the switch-off animation were separated by dividing the keyframe.  
The Lottie library supports the setMinFrame, setMaxFrame, and setProgress methods.  
Therefore, we can easily implement the above functions.  

### 1.2. Continuous Animation
